# api-docs

This package helps generate API docs in markdown based on our React component definitions.

## Contributing

> These contributing docs are for contributing to the api-docs package. If you want to update the API docs instead, you just need to run `yarn docs`.

First, run `yarn` to install the relevant dependencies.

After you change this package, to see the effect of your changes on the docs you must run `yarn build` to output files into `/dist`, before regenerating the docs with `yarn docs`.
