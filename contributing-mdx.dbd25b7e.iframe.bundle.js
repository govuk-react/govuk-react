We are loosely following the [structure that Jest uses](https://github.com/facebook/jest).\n\nAs such, the build process for development is slightly more involved than an `npm install`:\n\n1. Install npm 7.7 or later for workspaces support.\n\n2. Install dependencies, link packages, compile and start storybook:\n\n```sh\nyarn\nyarn build\nyarn start\n```\n\n## Creating a new component\n\nTo create a new component:\n\n- `yarn create-component -- my-new-component` where _my-new-component_ is the name of your new component.\n\nThis creates a folder named _my-new-component_ in `src/components` with the component file (index.js), a basic render test (test.js), and a default story (stories.js). You will need to add this to `src/stories/index.js` to view it in storybook.\n\n## Unit testing\n\nUnit testing follows similar patterns as [Glamorous with Jest](https://github.com/paypal/glamorous/tree/master/examples/with-jest), utilising [Jest _snapshots_](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/snapshot-testing.html), and [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme).\n\nTo run unit & eslint tests:\n\n```sh\nyarn test\n```\n\nTo run & watch unit tests:\n\n```sh\nyarn test:unit\n```\n\n## Generating docs\n\nMarkdown docs, in `README.md` files, are automatically generated based on the React component APIs. When making changes to component APIs, you should regenerate the docs to keep them in sync with the components.\n\nTo generate docs:\n\n```sh\nyarn docs\n```\n\n## Opening a pull request\n\n- when adding a new component, include a screenshot of the component in the PR\n- when adding new components, try to keep 1 component per PR, unless there are unavoidable interdependencies\n- when fixing a visual issue, include a unit test or snapshot test that proves the issue, and include a screenshot of the component before and after in the PR\n- when fixing a functional issue, include a unit test that proves the issue (fails before PR is merged and succeeds after)\n\n## Releasing\n\nIn order to prepare a release:\n\n- ensure you have [hub](https://hub.github.com) installed (e.g. `brew install hub`)\n- run `./scripts/release.sh`, followed by a [semver increment](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#functions) e.g. `./scripts/release.sh patch` (if this is the first time running hub, you will be asked for your GitHub credentials).\n- this will open a PR on GitHub and draft a release\n- Edit the PR and write the release notes in the PR description (see release notes below)\n- get approval for the PR (reviewers should be reviewing the release notes in the PR description) then merge the PR\n- once the PR is merged, open the [draft release corresponding to the new version number on GitHub](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react/releases), change the target branch to master, check the title and description and then click `Publish release`.\n\nWhen the tag is created, the CI server will automatically release to npm.\n\n### Release notes\n\nPlease refer to the commit history in GitHub since the last release. These can be copied directly and then categorised.\n\nPlease list in this order, using `##` for headings:\n\n- Breaking changes or anything or similar significance\n- Enhancements\n- Bug fixes\n- Documentation\n\nChanges that have no user facing changes, such as our Github workflows, do not need to be included.\n\nPlease look at [previous releases](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react/releases) for examples.\n\n## Conventions\n\nThe following conventions are planned but not fully implemented. We should be consistent on these before releasing version 1. At the point where the library is consistent, the conventions should be moved to README.md rather than CONTRIBUTING.md.\n\n### Fields vs. Inputs\n\nFor the purpose of this project:\n\n- A field is the combination of a label, input(s) and validation/error messages. The Field components used by this project should follow the prop structure of Final Form and Redux Form fields, in that they accept an `input` prop and a `meta` prop.\n- An input is just the form control that the user enters data in to, without a label or error/validation message. Inputs are normally associated with a Field and should be used on their own by importing the Field then using `<FieldName.Input />`. Inputs follow the prop structure of Final Form and Redux Form inputs.\n\nMore details in [issues/164](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react/issues/164.)\n\n### Anchors\n\nWe want to be router agnostic. We want to support parent projects using React Router or Reach Router, without introducing either as a dependency of this project. As such we provide an `as` prop on components that we expect can be used as React Router Links or NavLinks.\n\n### White Space\n\nHistorically components were build to have no white space around them. They were then wrapped with the `withWhiteSpace` HOC to set the default spacing below the component and also provide support for an `mb` prop to allow the parent application to override this spacing.\n\nWe have found that the use of the `withWhiteSpace` HOC can be problematic when it comes to applying complex styling rules involving descendent selectors, and thus it's use is now deprecated. Instead equivalent and enhanced facilities have been added to the `spacing` library in `@govuk-react/lib`.\n\nAt the time of writing we are at the beginning of the process of transitioning to this new spacing method.\n\nComponents are built to have white space around them to match their equivalents in [govuk-frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend). To assist with this, styling utility function are provided in the `spacing` library in `@govuk-react/lib`. Typically a component will use the `withWhiteSpace` function within a component to generate a styling function to apply to a styled component.\n\nThe `withWhiteSpace` function accepts default values for both `padding` and `margin`, and also provides support for overriding those defaults with equivalently named props. Spacing styles created are responsive and adjust for mobile/tablet sizes. For backward compatibility with the `withWhiteSpace` HOC it also supports a `marginBottom` config and `mb` prop.\n\nMore details in [issues/173](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react/issues/173)\nand [pull/523](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react/pull/523)\n";function _createMdxContent(props){return(0,jsx_runtime.jsxs)(jsx_runtime.Fragment,{children:[(0,jsx_runtime.jsx)(dist.h_,{title:"Docs/Contributing"}),"\n",(0,jsx_runtime.jsx)(dist.UG,{children:CONTRIBUTING_namespaceObject})]})}const contributing=function MDXContent(props={}){const{wrapper:MDXLayout}=Object.assign({},(0,lib.ah)(),props.components);return MDXLayout?(0,jsx_runtime.jsx)(MDXLayout,Object.assign({},props,{children:(0,jsx_runtime.jsx)(_createMdxContent,props)})):_createMdxContent()}},"../../node_modules/react/cjs/react-jsx-runtime.production.min.js":(__unused_webpack_module,exports,__webpack_require__)=>{var f=__webpack_require__("../../node_modules/react/index.js"),k=Symbol.for("react.element"),l=Symbol.for("react.fragment"),m=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty,n=f.__SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED.ReactCurrentOwner,p={key:!0,ref:!0,__self:!0,__source:!0};function q(c,a,g){var b,d={},e=null,h=null;for(b in void 0!==g&&(e=""+g),void 0!==a.key&&(e=""+a.key),void 0!==a.ref&&(h=a.ref),a)m.call(a,b)&&!p.hasOwnProperty(b)&&(d[b]=a[b]);if(c&&c.defaultProps)for(b in a=c.defaultProps)void 0===d[b]&&(d[b]=a[b]);return{$$typeof:k,type:c,key:e,ref:h,props:d,_owner:n.current}}exports.Fragment=l,exports.jsx=q,exports.jsxs=q},"../../node_modules/react/jsx-runtime.js":(module,__unused_webpack_exports,__webpack_require__)=>{module.exports=__webpack_require__("../../node_modules/react/cjs/react-jsx-runtime.production.min.js")}}]);
